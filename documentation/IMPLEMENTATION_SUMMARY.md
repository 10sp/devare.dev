## Requirements

The user wanted to:

- Restructure content within cards using drag and drop

- Implemented state management for article ordering
- Integrated with user preferences store to save reordered content
- Added CSS import for styling

#### SortableArticleItem.tsx

- Created new component to wrap ArticleItem with sortable functionality
- Implemented drag handles that appear only in organize mode
- Added proper styling and positioning for drag handles

#### preferences.ts

- Extended UserPreferencesStoreActions type

### 2. New Files

#### rssCard.css

- Styled drag handles to appear only in organize mode

#### RSS_CONTENT_REORDER.md

- Created documentation explaining the feature
- Documented technical implementation and usage

### 3. Updated Files

#### README.md

- Added feature to the features list
- Added feature to the data sources section

## Technical Approach

1. **Drag and Drop Library**: Used @dnd-kit library for robust drag and drop functionality
2. **State Management**: Used React state to manage article order within cards
3. **Persistence**: Integrated with existing user preferences store to save reordered content
4. **Organize Mode**: Only active when user is in organize mode
5. **Performance**: Used proper React.memo and efficient re-rendering techniques

## Key Features

- **Article Reordering**: Users can drag and drop articles within custom RSS cards
- **Organize Mode Integration**: Only active when organize mode is enabled
- **Automatic Saving**: New order is automatically saved to user preferences
- **Visual Feedback**: Drag handles appear only when in organize mode
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support through @dnd-kit

## Data Flow

1. Custom RSS card loads articles from `customContent` property
2. Articles are wrapped in `SortableArticleItem` components
3. When in organize mode, drag handles appear for each article
4. User can drag and drop articles to reorder them
5. On drop, the new order is saved to user preferences via `updateUserCustomCards` action

## Testing

Created unit tests to verify:

- Component renders correctly with custom content
- Articles are displayed in the correct order
- Drag and drop functionality works as expected

## Future Improvements

- Add visual feedback during drag operations
- Implement keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Add undo/redo functionality
- Support for grouping articles within cards

## Files Modified

1. `src/features/cards/components/rssCard/CustomContentRssCard.tsx` - Main implementation
2. `src/features/cards/components/rssCard/SortableArticleItem.tsx` - Sortable wrapper component
3. `src/stores/preferences.ts` - Added updateUserCustomCards action

## Conclusion

The RSS content reordering feature has been successfully implemented, allowing users to restructure and organize the content within RSS cards using intuitive drag and drop functionality. The implementation follows the existing code patterns and integrates seamlessly with the current organize mode functionality.
