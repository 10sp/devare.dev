# How to Use the RSS Feed Finder

The RSS Feed Finder is a powerful feature that helps you discover and add RSS feeds to your HackerTab feed. Here's how to use it:

## Automatic RSS Feed Detection

1. **Install the Browser Extension**: Make sure you have the HackerTab browser extension installed from the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons.

2. **Browse the Web**: As you visit websites, the extension automatically scans for RSS feeds.

3. **Receive Notifications**: When RSS feeds are detected, a notification will appear in the top-right corner of the page:

   - The notification shows how many feeds were found
   - You can choose to "Add to HackerTab" or "Ignore"

4. **Add Feeds**: Click "Add to HackerTab" to automatically add the detected feeds to your HackerTab feed.

## Manual RSS Feed Search

1. **Open Settings**: Click on the settings icon in HackerTab.

2. **Go to Sources**: Navigate to the "Sources" section.

3. **Find RSS Feeds**: Click the "Find RSS Feeds" button.

4. **Enter Website URL**: Type or paste the URL of the website you want to search for RSS feeds.

5. **Detect Feeds**: Click "Find Feeds" to scan the website.

6. **Select Feeds**: Check the boxes next to the feeds you want to add.

7. **Add to HackerTab**: Click "Add Selected Feed(s)" to add the feeds to your HackerTab feed.

## Troubleshooting

### RSS Feeds Not Detected

- Not all websites have RSS feeds
- Some websites may have feeds in non-standard locations
- Try manually entering common feed URLs like `/rss`, `/feed.xml`, or `/atom.xml`

### Feeds Not Adding to HackerTab

- Make sure you're using the browser extension, not just the web version
- Check that the extension has the necessary permissions
- Try refreshing the HackerTab page after adding feeds

### Performance Issues

- The RSS finder works best on modern websites
- Very large or complex websites may take longer to scan
- If you're experiencing issues, try searching for feeds on simpler websites first

## Privacy and Security

- The RSS finder only scans the current webpage for RSS feed links
- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- All processing happens locally in your browser
- Feeds are only added to your HackerTab when you explicitly choose to add them
